Utility **numpy_challenge.py** provides some functions for dealing with *one and two dimensional matrices* given in `numpy.array` format, 
such as *matrix multiplication*, *multidimensional distance computation*, and *distance matrix generation*. This functions based on Python **NumPy package**. 
You may use **numpy_challenge.py** functions in other programm after importing the utility as module `import numpy_challenge as {name}`. 
If you run **numpy_challenge.py** as the main program, it will also generate **three different numpy.arrays** and put them into `std.output`. 
Here some guidelines for how to use this script and how does it work.

Here some solutions for Python `pandas` and plot customization Tasks using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. 

## Task1. Real Data

- create functions for reading **.gff** and **.bed** files and converting them into `pandas.DataFrame`;
- make **rRNA_barplot** with rRNA type counts foe each reference genome based on **rrna_annotation.gff** data;
- reconstruct `bedtools intersect` using `pandas`

## Task2. Plot customization

- read **diffexpr_data.tsv.gz** file;
- create and customize **volcano plot** based on differential expression data from given file

## Task3. Pie Chart

- create and customize **bar of pie chart** where the first slice of the pie is "exploded" into a bar chart with a further breakdown of said slice's characteristics on **Top_100_Languages.csv** (arbitrary data)

All data files are in `./Homework_5/data` folder.
